Just my dotfiles from Arch Linux using Sway.

A basic ricing attempt from a complete newbie at Linux using Sway on Arch. It's not much but it's mine!

It features:

•Gaps

•Transparency

•Hidden borders

• A shortcut that triggers a killall of SIGUSR1 in waybar which hides the bar until the shortcut is pressed again for that sweet sweet screen estate.
