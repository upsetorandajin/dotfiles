Just my dotfiles from Arch Linux using Sway.

A basic ricing attempt from a complete newbie at Linux using Sway on Arch. It's not much but it's mine!

It features:

•Gaps

•Transparency

•Hidden borders

• A shortcut (mod+x) that triggers a killall of SIGUSR1 in waybar which hides the bar until the shortcut is pressed again for that sweet sweet screen estate.

Waybar was configured by the user cjbassi and can be found here:
